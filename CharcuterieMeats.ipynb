Traditional Lacón Gallego is made from pigs that have been fed with acorns, grains, and vegetables for at least three months before the slaughter.

The recipe is guarded as a trade secret, and every step in the production process is carried out entirely by hand. The process begins by rubbing salt of a special consistency with added herbs or spices into the ham and bone, which is then left to cure and dry in aging rooms for an extended period of time. To produce the smoked version, the hams are left in a smoking chamber over a beech and juniper wood fire. This process may take time, but it results in a characteristic dark red meat, golden-yellow rind, and a particularly mild and nutty flavor. To enjoy this delicacy, slice it thinly and serve it as an appetizer with pretzels and cheese.</td>\n",

It is spiced with black pepper and garlic, and white wine. The meat is finely ground, mixed with the spices and cure, stuffed into wide hog middles, and left for a 12- to 24-hour drying period. Once the surface has become tacky, the sausage is cold-smoked over juniper branches for two days, then hung to cure. Although it can be aged for a month or more, it is typically eaten after only a brief two weeks. The result is a very soft, moist sausage which can be spread on bread, in a manner similar to some pâtés.</td>\n",
